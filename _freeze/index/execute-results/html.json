The memory data gathered will then be used mainly for SRAM-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) analysis, as it is normally very difficult to gather enough data for this type of analysis.\n\n[NIMPHEL](https://servinagrero.github.io/nimphel/){.btn} is a generic, open-source framework tackling rapid design exploration for the generation of modular and parametric electronic designs that is able to work on any major simulator.\n\n[Monaco](https://servinagrero.github.io/monaco/){.btn} provides utilities to generate values that get injected into different templates. The user configures a project as a set of templates, a set of value generators and a command to be executed. The can be executed multiple times allowing the generation of mulitple files.\n\n[PUFR](https://servinagrero.github.io/pufr/){.btn} is an R library that provides functions and algorithms for the analysis and evaluation of Physical Unclonable Functions.\n\n\n## Interests\n\n- Photography\n- Baking\n\n## Publications\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n",
