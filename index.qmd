## A bit about me

I am a post-doctoral researcher at [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr/){.btn}, France. I received a PhD in _"Methodologies for the Design, the Modeling, and the Quality Assessment of Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs)"_ in 2024 by the Université Grenoble Alpes.

Right now I'm working on the creation of security protocols leveraging Photonic PUFs under the [NEUROPULS](https://neuropuls.eu/){.btn} European project. I do most of my work in R and Julia. I've also work with Python, Rust, VHDL and other plethora of tools and software.

When I'm not working I like to spend my time doing photography, baking and learning to play the piano.
