- name: SRAMPlatform
  url: https://servinagrero.github.io/SRAMPlatform/
  desc: >-
    is a platform is a collection of tools that aim to automate the process of collecting memory samples of numerous micro-controllers and their subsequent storage for future analysis. The memory data gathered will then be used mainly for SRAM-based Physical Unclonable Functions (PUF) analysis, as it is normally very difficult to gather enough data for this type of analysis.
- name: NIMPHEL

  desc: >- 
    is a generic, open-source framework tackling rapid design exploration for the generation of modular and parametric electronic designs that is able to work on any major simulator.

  desc: >-
    provides utilities to generate values that get injected into different templates. The user configures a project as a set of templates, a set of value generators and a command to be executed. The can be executed multiple times allowing the generation of mulitple files.
- name: PUFR
  url: https://servinagrero.github.io/pufr/
  desc: >-
    is an R library that provides functions and algorithms for the analysis and evaluation of Physical Unclonable Functions.
